Why this is important?
   It is undeniable that communication is one of the most essential skills for people nowadays. Having an effective way to transfer a person’s messages to others means better opportunities for life and a better relationship. It is known that there are 4 types of communication skills: Speaking, Reading, Listening, and Writing. However, in this project, an academic writing skill will be focused since it is the most difficult and technic-required part of all. There are two goals of this project: The first one is to learn the pattern of effective writing format based on IELTS task 2 essay scored 1 to 9 in order to understand the relations among those criteria (Coherence and Cohesion, Grammatical Range and Accuracy) under the lens of Natural Language Processing(NLP). The last goal is to gather that information as features to build the writing evaluation system with the principal of machine learning. Motivation: The writer is currently preparing himself to take the IELTS exam. The exam has four sessions (Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing). According to many testers’ experiences, the writing part is the most difficult one. On one hand, this skill needs a long time to practice and an experienced evaluator to help to check student’s essays. In another hand, its well-generated writing has a systematic pattern with specific rules such as coherence, cohesion, and grammatically range which is suitable for an application of NLP. Therefore, this project will deliver the machine learning model being able to evaluate the input essay with detail of the essay’s structure. It is hoped to be a useful commenced step to writing self-evaluation for the future project.
